This design is incomplete, it will require some OpenSCAD skills to finish.  

* A cheap bucket seat is bolted on the platform to the left
* Steering wheel and shifter are mounted on the table surface
  * There are some commented out modules in code for adding shifter lower and to the side.  They got too complex for my tastes.
* Pedals are mounted inverted
* Intended screen was a VR headset
* A set of fixed wheels are on the front so this can be moved and flipped on its end for storage.
